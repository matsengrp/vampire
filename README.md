[![Docker Cloud Build Status](https://img.shields.io/docker/cloud/build/matsengrp/vampire.svg)](https://cloud.docker.com/u/matsengrp/repository/docker/matsengrp/vampire/general) &nbsp;
[![Travis CI status](https://travis-ci.org/matsengrp/vampire.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/matsengrp/vampire)

This is a package to fit and test variational autoencoder (VAE) models for T cell receptor sequences.

It is described in the paper _Deep generative models for T cell receptor protein sequences_ by Kristian Davidsen, Branden J Olson, William S DeWitt III, Jean Feng, Elias Harkins, Philip Bradley and Frederick A Matsen IV.


## Install

### Setting up your environment

[Conda](https://conda.io) is the canonical way to install and is required run the pipeline, although not strictly a dependency for fitting and using VAEs using this code.
These instructions will assume that you have [installed Conda](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html).

If you want to see the entire installation process, see the Dockerfile.
However, if you simply want to train and use vampire models, you can only execute

    conda env create -f install/environment.yml

This will create a `vampire` Conda environment which you can enter and use for running vampire.
If you also want to be able to compare repertoires using [sumrep](https://github.com/matsengrp/sumrep/) you will need to run the R installation steps in the Dockerfile.
We also provide an `install/environment-olga.yml` to make a Conda environment in which one can run [OLGA](https://github.com/zsethna/OLGA/).

### vampire installation

After setting up your environment (if you followed the steps above you'll need to `conda activate vampire`), and run

    pip install .

in the repository.

If you want to use sumrep, see `install/test.sh` for additional install instructions.


## Running

To get started, check out the demonstration script in `vampire/demo/demo.sh`, which will show you how models and training parameters are specified.

To run the main pipeline on sample data, try running `scons -n` inside the `vampire` directory.
Execute the commands on example data by running `scons`.
You can run these in parallel using the `-j` flag for scons.
Note that this pipeline runs on a very small data set (mixing training and testing) just for example purposes-- it does not give an appropriately trained model.

In order to run on your own data, use `python util.py split-repertoires` to split your repertoires into train and test.
This will make a JSON file pointing to various paths.
You can run the pipeline on those data by running `scons --data=/path/to/your/file.json`.

Note that the frequency estimation pipeline is run using `scons --pipe=pipe_freq`.

### Cluster execution

The pipeline includes a `--clusters` flag that, if used, will attempt to submit jobs to a [SLURM](https://slurm.schedmd.com/overview.html) cluster with the specified name.
If you have access to a cluster with a different cluster scheduler, hopefully you can modify the `execute.py` script accordingly.


## Documentation

The documentation consists of

0. the demonstration script
1. the two pipelines, which will give you commands to try
2. command line help, which is accessed for example via `tcr-vae --help` and `tcr-vae train --help`
3. lots of docstrings in the source code

Please get in touch if anything isn't clear.


## Limitations

* Our preprocessing scripts exclude TCRBJ2-5, which Adaptive annotates badly, and TCRBJ2-7, which appears to be problematic for OLGA.
* We use Adaptive gene names and sequences, but will extend to more flexible TCR gene sets in the future.


## Contributors

* Original version (immortalized in the [`original` branch](https://github.com/matsengrp/vampire/tree/original)) by Kristian Davidsen.
* Pedantic rewrite, sconsery, extension, additional models, and comparative evaluation by Frederick "Erick" Matsen.
* Contributions from Phil Bradley, Will DeWitt, Jean Feng, Eli Harkins, and Branden Olson.


## Code styling

This project uses [YAPF](https://github.com/google/yapf) for code formatting with a format defined in `setup.cfg`.
You can easily run yapf on all the files with a call to `yapf -ir .` in the root directory.

Code also checked using [flake8](http://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/).
`# noqa` comments cause lines to be ignored by flake8.
