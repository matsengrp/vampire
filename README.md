# vampire

## Install

First [install conda](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html).

The install process for the entire pipeline is documented in the Dockerfile.

However, if you simply want to train and use vampire models, you only need to execute

    conda env create -f install/environment.yml

This will create a `vampire` conda environment which you can use.
If you also want to be able to compare repertoires using [sumrep](https://github.com/matsengrp/sumrep/) you will need to run the R installation steps in the Dockerfile.
We also provide an `install/environment-olga.yml` to make a conda environment in which one can run [OLGA](https://github.com/zsethna/OLGA/).


## Running

Get a list of example commands by running `scons -n` inside the `vampire` directory.
Execute the commands on example data by running `scons`.
You can run these in parallel using the `-j` flag for scons.
Note that this pipeline runs on a very small data set just for example purposes-- it does not give an appropriately trained model.

In order to run on your own data, use `python util.py split-repertoires` to split your repertoires into train and test.
This will make a JSON file pointing to various paths.
You can run the pipeline on those data by running `scons --data=/path/to/your/file.json`.


## Documentation

The documentation consists of

1. the example pipeline, which will give you commands to try
2. command line help, which is accessed for example via `tcr-vae --help` and `tcr-vae train --help`
3. lots of docstrings in the source code


## Limitations

* Our preprocessing scripts exclude TCRBJ2-5, which Adaptive annotates badly, and TCRBJ2-7, which appears to be problematic for OLGA.
* We use Adaptive gene names and sequences, but will extend to more flexible TCR gene sets in the future.


## Contributors

* Original version (immortalized in the [`original` branch](https://github.com/matsengrp/vampire/tree/original)) by Kristian Davidsen.
* Pedantic rewrite, sconsery, extension, additional models, and comparative evaluation by Erick Matsen.

## Code styling

This project uses [YAPF](https://github.com/google/yapf) for code formatting with a format defined in `setup.cfg`.
You can easily run yapf on all the files with a call to `yapf -ir .` in the root directory.

Code also checked using [flake8](http://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/).
`# noqa` comments cause lines to be ignored by flake8.
